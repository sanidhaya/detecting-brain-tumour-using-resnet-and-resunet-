# Detecting brain tumour using ResNet50 model

##### Resnet50 is transfer learning algorithm used for image classification. I tried to impliment here to detect brain tumour, an effort to reduce the human effort. Later I even added the U-net architecture so as to make it more efficient.

##### I used Google-colab to impliment my work cause its free and a pretty powerfull tool to use. Most of the libraries used for machine learning(such as scikit-learn, tensorflow, cv2) are already available in the colaboratory.
